# INET4710
Work from INET4710, machine learning class scaled to Big Data Platform at UMN.

Class used Python Jupyter Notebooks. We used Apache Spark and aws. My final project was fascinating - researching neural networks, and buiilding three distinct ones with pytorch to classify the Urban Sound Dataset https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html.
